#Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
In Python, sets and dictionaries are two important data structures that provide powerful ways to manage and manipulate data. Understanding how to use sets and dictionaries effectively can greatly enhance your ability to work with data in Python.

## Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined using curly braces {} or the set() function. Here are some key features of sets:

- Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate element, it will be ignored.
- Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from a set after it is created.
- Sets are unordered, which means that the elements have no specific order.

```Python
# Creating a set using curly braces
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}

# Creating a set using the set() function
colors = set(['red', 'blue', 'green'])
```

## Dictionaries
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary is unique and maps to a value. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {} and colons : to separate keys and values.

```Python
# Creating a dictionary
person = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'occupation': 'Engineer'
}
```
