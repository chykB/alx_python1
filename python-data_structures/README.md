# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
This repository provides an overview of two essential data structures in Python: Lists and Tuples. As a Python developer, a strong understanding of these data structures is crucial for efficient data handling and manipulation.

## Lists
Lists in Python are ordered, mutable collections that can store elements of different data types. They are enclosed in square brackets [] and separated by commas. Lists are versatile and widely used due to their dynamic nature and ability to store elements in any order.
